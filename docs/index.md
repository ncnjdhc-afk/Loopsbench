# LoopsBench

LoopsBench evaluates AI coding agents on long-horizon terminal tasks. Each task packages a source workspace, requirements, dependency graphs, Docker execution metadata, and verifiers that distinguish incomplete, partial, and complete solutions.

## What LoopsBench Provides

- A Python package and CLI for listing tasks, validating tasks, and running agents.
- Docker-backed task execution with remote, local-build, and local-existing image strategies.
- Built-in adapters for Oracle, Mini SWE-agent, SWE-agent, OpenHands, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Qwen Code, and Copilot.
- A GitHub-native contribution workflow for task proposals, task PRs, validation, and trusted publishing.
- Generated API documentation for the modules that power the benchmark harness.

## Benchmark Shape

LoopsBench tasks are meant to capture realistic development arcs. A task can include:

- an agent-visible `base/` workspace
- `task.yaml` metadata and natural-language instructions
- module and unit dependency graphs
- unit-level requirement files
- Docker files for client and tester containers
- public and hidden tests
- an Oracle solution or gold patch used by maintainers for validation

## Paper

The LoopsBench paper is coming soon. Until the arXiv preprint is available, cite the repository URL and the exact commit SHA used for experiments.
